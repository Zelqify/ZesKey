# ZesKey
ZesKey is an app to make your keyboard clicks sound like blue-switched keyboards.

# How To Use?
* Basically open the ZesKey.exe file.

# More

* You are able to upload your own audio as press.wav. (WARNING: Your audio must be .wav and compaitable.)
* Holding action is not recommended because of the looping sound.


ZesKey is still work in process and we're hoping to make the application GUI based.
